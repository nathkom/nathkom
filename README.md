## Hi, I'm Nathan Komissarchik 👋
### A bit about me
I’m an Informatics student at the University of Washington with interests in
human-centered design, data systems, and technology risk & governance.
I enjoy working on projects where technical decisions intersect with policy,
compliance, and real-world constraints. I'm currently spending a lot of my own study time
learning cybersecurity!
